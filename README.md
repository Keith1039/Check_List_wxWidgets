# Instructions

If your computer is a Windows PC, you can simply download and run the checklist.exe file.
If not, then it isn't currently possible to use the application without building it yourself. 
This project is just meant to be a proof of concept so I don't plan on spending more time on this. 
If I do find a way to build the app for Linux and Mac platforms then I will update the repo to reflect that.

This project is based off of this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPLfOoRUKMU) although I modified the
code that was shown to suit my purposes.
